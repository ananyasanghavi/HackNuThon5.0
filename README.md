# LifeChanger <br/>

LifeChanger helps conduct interviews in a far more easier and efficient way. It gives a set of questions to a virtually generated digital human and the AI generated human conducts the interviews with candidates in a human-like manner. <br/>

We have used the following applications to create a platform for conducting Interviews using Virtual AI Generated Digital Humans: <br/>
-React JS <br/>
-Tailwind CSS <br/>
-API <br/>
-Clerk Authentication <br/>
-Python3 <br/>
-Postman <br/>
-STT <br/>
-TTS <br/>
-Virtual Avatar <br/>
-JSON <br/>

*How to use:*
1.git clone https://github.com/ananyasanghavi/HackNuThon5.0<br />
2.npm i <br />
3.npm run dev <br />

In python file it takes the text which converts to the virtual avatar using the D-ID Api
